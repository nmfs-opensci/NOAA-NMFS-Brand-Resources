# Branding Resources for NOAA NMFS Projects

This repository contains resources for implementing NOAA's branding guidelines across reports, websites, applications, and presentations. NMFS OpenSci will be developing several templates that provide standard branded formats. We will be leveraging the new [`_brand.yml`](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/) feature developed by Posit to integrate NOAA's branding into templates for Quarto, R, Python, and Shiny projects. Stay tuned for more features, templates, and more!
